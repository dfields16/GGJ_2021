## Game brainstorm
Player loses dimensions and has to find them again.

Start with cutscene where player dies in 3D which doubles as tutorial. Player then is sent to the first dimension where they approach an orb guided by audio cues, although they can only move in one direction. Then, they have to navigate through the 2nd dimension to find the 3rd dimension and their body.

If we have time, then add 4D where player time travels to before they die.
